# The Sushi Game

### Overview
The game consists of 4 chefs competing in a restaurant in order to win over
customers and produce the best possible food. In the process, chefs accrue
financial capital and use it purchase new resources and develop better cuisine
for their customers.

### Technologies
The frontend design was completed using the Java Swing API. Several OOP concepts
such as Factory Design Patterns and Iterators were used in order to build the
application. Various Data Structures such as Linked Lists were also used. The
project really helped me understand the relationship between frontend and backend
design. It also helped me to write better algorithms that made my app run faster
each time.
